Windows client steps

Windows client needs a build of hadoop's source code in windows environment to work. This takes much effort to do so. 
So usually you can find someone built & uploaded in internet

--kerberos setup
Make sure you have right JDK installed & krb5.conf file copied to jre/lib/security folder
Also verify you are able to execute kinit & klist the generated tickets
krb5.conf file can be obtained from keberos server installation

Notes:
You should always usse JDK bundled kinit & klist. You can execute them directly switching over to JDK/bin folder.
You should generate a forwardable ticket & verify the same. Below is sample

G:\JAVA\JDK\1.7.0_45\bin>kinit -f hduser1@EXP.COM
Password for hduser1@EXP.COM:
New ticket is stored in cache file C:\Users\Shrikanth\krb5cc_Shrikanth

G:\JAVA\JDK\1.7.0_45\bin>klist -f -e -c C:\Users\Shrikanth\krb5cc_Shrikanth

Credentials cache: C:\Users\Shrikanth\krb5cc_Shrikanth

Default principal: hduser1@EXP.COM, 1 entry found.

---hadoop set up 

-Copy hadoop installation directly from target server & make sure all *env.sh files contain the right JAVA_HOME location

-Now update the HADOOP_HOME/bin directory with the windows build bin folder should good enough

You should have list of changes as mentioned below in both server & client (brute force)
Make sure yarn-site.xml contains the absolute DNS/IP paths as mentioned below
