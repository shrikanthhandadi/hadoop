--Packages that we will install during the complete procedure will ask us a series of questions through the so-called debconf interface. To configure debconf to a known state, run:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure debconf

--Monitoring log files is crucial in detecting problems. The straight-forward, catch-all routine to this is opening a terminal and running:

cd /var/log; sudo tail -F daemon.log sulog user.log auth.log debug kern.log syslog dmesg messages kerberos/{krb5kdc,kadmin,krb5lib}.log
